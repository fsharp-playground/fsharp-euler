Project Euler Problem 5
2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers 
from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?
This solution came from here: http://geekswithblogs.net/Erik/archive/2008/02/19/119734.aspx *)

The function primeFactors has been a workhorse for solving other euler problems.
Thanks Erik. *)
